## Purpose:
The purpose of this assignment is to gain insight about your thought process, and your approach to solving accessibility challenges in a real world situation.

## Timeline:
Out of respect for your time, and to better understand how you think, we ask that you take no more than two hours to complete this assignment.

## Your task:
Create a list of accessibility improvements for the provider search tool that is part of the Healthcare.gov ‘Window Shopping tool’ available at: [healthcare.gov/see-plans/](https://healthcare.gov/see-plans/)

### Window Shopping provider search tool

The provider search tool enables users to search for Medical providers (such as doctors), Medical facilities, and drugs to add to their temporary window shopping search for insurance plans. Once added, consumers can then quickly determine which plans cover their doctors, medical facilities or drugs. While not critical to searching for an insurance plan, the provider search provides a useful way for consumers to make more informed decisions about their health insurance.

Using the steps below, document 2-5 accessibility improvements (user stories, or plain text bullet points) that you would recommend be made to this section of the Window Shopping application. These can improve either Section 508 compliance, or overall accessibility experience for a consumer visiting the site with assistive technology.

These should include (but are not limited to) improvements to:

- Visual to the UI (CSS, visual elements)
