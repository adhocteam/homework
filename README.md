Ad Hoc homework problems
========================

Each directory contains a homework problem, seven in total. Please complete at least one--but not more than three--of the problems before submitting. Make sure to read the README in each directory,
it will give you important information on completing each problem.

This is an open-book test, so Google away, but please don't copy your work from pre-existing solutions you may find or ask
others to help you complete the exercises. Solutions should be able to be run on a UNIX command line (Linux/Mac). We're quite familiar with Go, Ruby, Javascript, and Python, but if your submission is in some other language (which is OK), please let us know how we can set up our environment to run your code.

Which problems should I try?
------------

Well, that depends on the position you're applying for! Here are some suggestions:

 - Front-end Developer: [hhbuilder](https://github.com/adhocteam/homework/tree/master/hhbuilder) and [fetch](https://github.com/adhocteam/homework/tree/master/fetch)
 - Software Engineer (Full-stack): [hhbuilder](https://github.com/adhocteam/homework/tree/master/hhbuilder) and [slcsp](https://github.com/adhocteam/homework/tree/master/slcsp)
 - DevOps Engineer (Site Reliability): [provision](https://github.com/adhocteam/homework/tree/master/provision) and [proto](https://github.com/adhocteam/homework/tree/master/proto)
 - Web Designer with Accessibility / 508 Expertise: [accessibility](https://github.com/adhocteam/homework/tree/master/accessibility)

These are just suggestions; if you really want to give other problems a shot, go for it, but don't do more than three of them before hearing back from us.

Getting help
------------

If you get stuck, have a question, or want to clarify any aspect of the
homework, you can contact members of our development team by
joining our [public Slack channel.](https://adhocteam-public.herokuapp.com)

We think a sign of a good developer is one who asks questions sooner, rather
than later. We are happy to help guide you to the right solution.

Submitting your completed homework
----------------------------------

To submit your homework, zip up the contents of your git repo in a .zip file.
Please remove the .git directory, and *anything else that might identify you*.
If you want to include any comments with your submission, add them to the
COMMENTS file. If there's anything important for us to know about how to run
your code, please include that information in the COMMENTS file. Feel free to include any other information relevant to your
submission in the COMMENTS as well. Then visit our
[homework app](https://adhocteam.herokuapp.com/candidates/sign_up), sign up
for an account, and follow the instructions to upload your homework there!

In addition to submitting the homework, make sure to complete the application
for the job you're applying for on [our jobs page](https://www.adhocteam.us/join).

Evaluation process
------------------

When we receive your homework, we'll assign it a random number, so that our team
does not know whose submission they are reviewing. Your homework will be
reviewed by at least three senior engineers on our team.

A quick tip
-----------

A note about what we're looking for: we tend to favor solutions that clearly
and concisely solve the problem at hand. We're not looking for an
over-engineered solution. We want to see how you approach the problem,
understand what's being asked, and solve it. We tend to favor solutions that
are simple, elegant, and efficient. Submit a solution as if you were giving it
to a colleague for code review.

Good luck! We look forward to reviewing your submission.
