Parse a custom protocol format
==============================

Your application must interface with an old-school mainframe MPS7 for payment
processing. This means consuming a proprietary binary protocol format.

Task
----

You must read in a file, `txnlog.dat`, and parse it according to the
specification in Notes below.

You must answer the following questions:

* What is the total amount in dollars of debits?
* What is the total amount in dollars of credits?
* How many autopays were started?
* How many autopays were ended?
* What is balance of user ID 2456938384156277127?

You must supply your source code as part of your answer. You may use whatever
programming language you choose.

Notes
-----

MPS7 transaction log specification:

Header:

| 4 byte magic string "MPS7" | 1 byte version | 4 byte (uint32) # of records |

Record:

| 1 byte record type enum | 4 byte (uint32) Unix timestamp | 8 byte (uint64) user ID |

Record type enum:

* 0x01: Debit
* 0x02: Credit
* 0x03: StartAutopay
* 0x04: EndAutopay

For Debit and Credit record types, there is an additional field, an 8 byte
(float64) amount in dollars, at the end of the record.

All multi-byte fields are encoded in network byte order.
