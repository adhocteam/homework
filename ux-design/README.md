UX Design
=================

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to get a greater understanding of how you approach design problems.

## Instructions

Imagine you've been tasked with designing an interface that allows a patient to schedule an appointment with their doctor online.

### Submission

Prepare a set of questions to bring to a kick-off meeting. You know that their current systems have some rudimentary online tools, but it's mostly a paper-driven organization.

- What are the first 10 questions that you would ask?
- If you had to pick just five of them, which would you prioritize and why? 

Submit *both* your initial set of 10 questions, and your prioritized set of five questions.

Answer in under 800 words, and store as a plain text file (without any personally identifying information).

When you are done, create a zip file containing that file, [create a candidate account on our recruiting site](https://people.adhoc.team/) and upload your solution.
