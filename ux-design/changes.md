I coded and designed my portfolio from scratch using Jekyll. However, I would like to focus on discussing one of my favorite projects I worked on that involved gamification. It is a care plan for the COPD Foundation, and the link that shows all the interfaces, wireframes, and coded assets is here: https://dmarooney1105.github.io/project1/ As healthcare is very intricate and this project was very extensive, It has a lot of steps to it. However, I ave summarized my process below. 

## Problem 
COPD Patients needed a better way to access education to help manage their disease.
## Solution
Collaborated with COPD Foundation and internal team to drill down into the users and get a sense of who they are, what their pain points are, demographic etc. 
Developed a "virtual and interactive journey to managing their disease."
## Steps / Building Blocks:
*Creating a program that did not just involve the patient and a computer.  We also added a "partner in care" feature, where the patient can choose to add a spouse or family member to follow alongside their journey/program and keep them on track. 
* Gamification -I researched and read books on gamification and how we could incorporate it into the system to further engage the patient to the health program. This involved also working with COPD Foundation's marketing team to ensure we aligned the theme with their branding and overall messaging.
* Redesigning the dashboard - I redesigned AND developed (coded) a dashboard using the software's page builder to make it an intuitive place for patients to access education, activities, and their peer coach. 
## Wireframes
I created wireframes of the different dashboards we could make that included the high level idea of gamification based on lots of research. 
## Build 
To be able to quickly ship the first iteration, I cut down a lot of features for gamification. I had to collaborate with development to really think about what could be practical to build in a month's timeframe that would also allow for tacking on additional features while still incorporating the "gamification experience." So I chose to narrow it down to the overall theme, the points, and achievement badges. The points and achievement badges also had dual roles of a "progress bar" so the patient knew where their stood in their journey. I also created a library of coded resources so the Solution Architects could copy and paste the code (the chat bubbles, download panels etc. because they did not exist on our system). Eventually, the developers created these into widgets. 
## Testing
Because of HIPPA compliant laws and privacy laws, the only way we were able to do in-person user-testing was through the nurses and colleagues family members who had COPD - we watched them use the platform and give us direct feedback
When the program when live with real patients, I created user surveys to get feedback on usability and overall experience. 
## Successes
We presented the program to many health systems. Johns Hopkins and Carolinas Health Systems both loved the program and signed contracts with the company to include the COPD program in their overall care platform.
