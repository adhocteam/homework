# Nicole Corbin – UX Problem & Solution

### Come up with a new solution to capture ratings / reviews of a doctor from their patients.

Problem
1. Low user engagement – patients select an overall rating and then bounce off the page.
2. We are unable to collect useful data from the form due to user flow.
3. The form does not render properly on all device types. 
4. The form looks long and tedious to our users.

Solution Description

There were many issues reguarding the current rating form being used on the website. The first step I took was to do extensive research on other rating forms across the web and mobile applications. I tested rating forms on sites such as Amazon, Yelp, and Tripadvisor as well as apps like Uber, Apples' App Store, Google Maps etc. Since the site is headed towards a material design approach, I did further exploration on form design and execution based on the Google Material Design principals. This lead to design workshops, multiple iterations, and internal UX testing to come up with the solution I am showcasing.

The research and new design methodology lead me to create a mobile-first solution using a material design stepper. Since the form should be easy for any user and be consumed on any device, I decided to break up the questions on three different pages instead of keeping everything in one long form. Each page would let the user submit without forcing them to go further, which helps the site capture more data. We encourage them to finish the entire form by having a clean, simple UI, and incorporating motivating microcopy. The stepper acts like a progress bar to the users. They know how much they have completed and what steps they have until the end, this gives them a sense of accomplishment without being overwelmed. 

This project is currently being prototyped and tested before a production release. The responses from our UX and A/B testing are very positive. Users like the ease and cleanliness of the Material Design approach site-wide. My attached mocks are of the workflow on a mobile device from form launch through form completion.
