Assignment

My team’s task was to redesign the search screen in a mental health enterprise application. The original search design was developed in 2001 and had been repeatedly revised by the company in an attempt to improve the screen and meet the needs of different users. 

Our team consisted of a software engineer, product owner, business analyst, front-end developer, product support manager, and user experience designer (myself).

Challenges

We did not have access to end-users or search data that could tell us how this screen was being used. In addition, this screen was being used by different types of users (clinicians, nurses, case managers, and administrators). We were informed that each of these users searched using the data with which they were most familiar, resulting in the screen having a variety of search capabilities. 

Goals

Ultimately, our goal was to improve the user experience of the screen and help users find the data they needed quickly and without frustration. We also wanted to make sure that more data points could be added to the search screen easily in the future, without affecting user experience. Finally, we wanted to make sure that the new design could be easily integrated into different sections of the application. 

Process

To prepare for our team meetings, I met with our support team and reviewed data they had collected. This information helped me understand the issues users were encountering on this screen.  I spoke with our business analysts and account managers to understand the different types of users and their related workflows within the system, and to learn about the software history and how this screen’s user interface and function changed over time. I developed three different user personas based on the information I collected.

In our weekly team meetings we discussed the information I gathered, as well as the personas and their workflows. The software engineer and front-end developer helped us understand the technology that would be used to develop the new search screen (Angular JS). 

Using all available information, we sketched various approaches that supported the different user workflows. Over the course of a few sessions, we developed a basic search design that would be the default landing screen, as well as an advanced search screen (see images below). The advanced search is a simple query builder. Its default view has an initial input to guide first-time users on how to use this screen. On this screen users can add or remove search criteria; save and name queries; and select a query as their default search option.

User Feedback
As we worked on the prototype development, we finally gained access to two different types of end users (6 individuals total). We conducted user testing with these 6 individuals and each expressed excitement seeing the new search screens. Each user was able to navigate the search screens without issue and quickly identify the specific search queries they needed for their use.

Conclusion 
Although we did not have access to end-users during the initial research and ideation part of our work, we were able to inform our work using data from our support team and business analysts to develop a solution that, during user testing, seemed to improve users’ daily tasks and reduce frustration.
