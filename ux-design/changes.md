##  Touch Screen Dashboard UI/UX Design

### Product
I recently designed a manufacturing dashboard application that was displayed on a large 72-inch touchscreen mounted on a factory wall. The app would automate the scheduling and tracking of all orders through manufacturing. 

### Challenge
The challenge or problems with the design of this app was how to show active orders, work schedule, and shipping schedule in an interface that would allow users to drag orders to different days, assign different shifts, and track orders from initiation to shipping. The client wanted a way to show current orders, and what days they were being worked on, as well as pending orders, and due dates. 
They were using a whiteboard at the time to track all of this.:point_right: http://josephshermandesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Whiteboardphoto.jpg

### Solution
My solution was to split the information into 2 screens, a week-day production planner, and a shipping schedule planner. Each order could be selected by touching it and dragging it to a new day, or schedule. A double tap would bring up a detailed view of the order. Users could now quickly see where an order was, what it was, and if it was overdue or not.
