One of the more unique (and fun) projects I worked on recently was revamping the user experience of a mobile application I developed back in 2016 for both iOS and Android. This was while I was working at Bitstop, a bitcoin ATM company in Miami, Florida. The overall purpose of the application was a “one-stop”, multiple currency, multiple market bitcoin price tracking tool, hence the name “Bitcoin Tools.” I wasn’t entirely involved in the naming process, but I digress. Due to the “one-stop” nature and keeping with the parent company’s branding of “Bitstop”, I began sketching wireframes of a single paged, minimalistic inspired version of the application.

#### Original Design

I sat down with the CTO and mobile application developers to show them what I had, and we quickly came to the consensus that the best way to build this application was, as I originally thought, using a single-page-application model (or SPA for short) and using React Native to facilitate the design and development process. React Native is a technology that allowed us to design only one application and allowed us build an “isomorphic” Javascript application. Isomorphic means Javascript would be used on both the server and the client allowing for server side rendering. This was a large factor in deciding the design and development process moving forward. Here are high-fidelity prototypes of my first iteration of designs from 2016.

#### Redesign
A year later I was tasked in redesigning the application. I was asked to redesign in a way that doesn’t make the app unfamiliar to the already growing, global user base. The main aspect to focus on was the functionality and look of the displayed conversion price (at the top) and the graph (in the middle.) We were trying to achieve a feeling of levity and removing many of the large red elements. Red is the main branding color, but can cause distress and discomfort to a user when seeing large swaths of the color. To mitigate this issue I removed the red fill from the Price Graph and instead chose to use a solid red line. Along with softening up the dark defining lines in the pricing data at the footer of the application, we achieved a lighter feel that didn’t assault the users vision by seeing mostly red every time they opened the application. As for the large displayed price conversion, I removed the “equals” sign and moved the conversion button into it’s place. This consolidated space in the application and removed clutter. Here are the high-fidelity prototypes we passed on to the developers of the most recent iteration of the application.

#### Purpose and Takeaways
This was especially fun for me due to the fact that it was being used by so many people. You can download the application on the Google or Apple Store by searching for Bitcoin Tools. The notion of people using products I work on speaks volumes to me and keeps me focused on the task at hand. Being able to produce content and products that affects the masses is something I feel is crucial to my career development. I especially learned a lot in terms of agility of designing deliverables. Each iteration took no longer than a week to pass on to developers.
